for the nav bar... default would be row.. on small screen it changes to column with only logo showing and other components hidden.

*set a background for all properties except the one for the logo
*set the width to 100% and then set transition
* all this happens with the onclick of hamburger menu


For our media queries, we are working with a top to bottom approach. this means that rather than use min-width in media queries, we would make
use of max-width, being we are scaling from top to bottom
